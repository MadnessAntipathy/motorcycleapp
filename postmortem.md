What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
I would nest my model calls within each model to keep my code neat and tidy.

Code and Code Design
What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
Probably some CSS styling. I saw a lot of good designs that I would like to implement in my next project.


What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
I liked how I handled my data calls by assigning them the same variables. It helps my to reuse existing code as I do not have to drastically change the way I call the data.


For each, please include code examples.
Code snippet up to 20 lines.
Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.

WDI Unit 2 Post Mortem
What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
I did not try to extend my project beyond my objectives and worked on each objective in a sequential order. It helps me to keep my focus on the task at hand.


What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
I tend to accept what I have as my objective. I would need to constantly remind myself that there is always improvement.


How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
It is quite fast. I am hoping for more in-depth dive into the topics covered.
