# MVC template files

Start your MVC app here by copying this boilerplate code.

Why I created this app:
My love for motorcycling led me to create this app which allows riders to create, find and join events.

App Usage:
Unregistered users will be directed to the home page. They have access to the events page but without creating an
account, they will not be able to sign up, comment or submit event photos.

Registered users will have full access to the app. They will be able to view other user's profile page, find out
which events they are going for and leave comments and photos on the event page.
